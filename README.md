Random Poller User
==================

Example of **using** the RandomPoller component. I use the `src` directory for
develoment and the `release` directory for `make` output.

To run:
*  Build the project with `make`
*  Run the project with `node index.js`

You should see `Fire!` get printed at a randomly chosen interval.

To Reset
--------

Run `make clean`

Things I Still Don't Quite Understand
-------------------------------------

This example runs, but I'm not entirely sure how I should be thinking of these `index.js` files...
